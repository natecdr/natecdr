### <p>Tennis match outcome prediction - 2021</p>
A Machine Learning project which consists in predicting the outcome of a Rafael Nadal match using only Nadal's grunts.
The first part of the project consisted in the extraction of these grunts out of the raw match audio, and the second one in the prediction of the outcome using those extracted clips.
<br/>
The project was proposed by a colleague of mine and myself to our school after we got the idea from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003347217301975">this study</a>.

### <a href="https://gitlab.insa-rouen.fr/ldaniele/tw2">TextR - 2021</a>
TextR is a simple text-only social network. It has all the main features you can expect to find in a social network : Profiles, Posts, Likes, Favorites, ...
Made in a team of 4.

### <a href="https://github.com/natecdr/image_vector_quantization">Image vector quantization - 2021</a>
Image Vector Quantization is Vector Quantization applied to an image. It works by representing the image with few of its most representative blocks (or vectors).
It is widely used in lossy data compression.

### <p>HOG - 2021</p>
HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) is a feature descriptor used in Computer Vision for object detection and image recognition.
The project was about implementing the technique.

### <p>Huffman Compressor - 2020</p>
This project was actually implemented 2 times, the first time in C and the second time in Python.
Huffman compression is a widely used lossless data compression method.

### <a href="https://github.com/natecdr/midi_guitar_tabs">MIDI to guitar tab convertor - 2021</a>

A tool that converts a MIDI file to a guitar tab. It mainly uses graph theory to find the optimal finger positions.
<br/>
The project is to be continued with a new machine learning approach.

### <a href="https://github.com/natecdr/ASCII-art">ASCII Art - 2020</a>
A tool that converts image input into ASCII art (A representation of the image using ASCII characters only).
<br/>
As of now, it can convert still images, videos and the computer webcam video stream.

### <a href="https://github.com/natecdr/Life-Sim">Life Simulation</a> - Work In Progress
A life simulation using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) Genetic algorithm. 
Creatures evolve through generations using random mutations that alter the architecture of their brain. Each creature has its own brain that is essentially a neural network, their inputs being the creature's "senses" and their outputs being the actions the creature can take.
